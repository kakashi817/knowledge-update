# knowledge-update

This is an HTML folder with the intent of updating how far I've come as a programmer and what all I've learned so far with coding. It was a suggestion made
by one of the programmers in a community I'm in. My goal for this repository is to showcase my skills and prove to myself that over time, I am getting better
day by day.
